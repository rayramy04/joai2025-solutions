# Jupyter Notebook files - keep as-is to show ML/DS work
# Output has been cleared so file size is reasonable (~33KB)

# Alternative configurations if needed later:
# *.ipynb linguist-generated=true  # Exclude from stats entirely
# *.ipynb linguist-documentation   # Mark as documentation
# *.ipynb linguist-language=Python # Count as Python

# Mark specific file types
*.html linguist-detectable=false
